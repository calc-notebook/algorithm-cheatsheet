**描述**

Cows are such finicky eaters. Each cow has a preference for certain foods and drinks, and she will consume no others.Farmer John has cooked fabulous meals for his cows, but he forgot to check his menu against their preferences. Although he might not be able to stuff everybody, he wants to give a complete meal of both food and drink to as many cows as possible.Farmer John has cooked *F* (1 ≤ *F* ≤ 100) types of foods and prepared *D* (1 ≤ *D* ≤ 100) types of drinks. Each of his *N* (1 ≤ *N* ≤ 100) cows has decided whether she is willing to eat a particular food or drink a particular drink. Farmer John must assign a food type and a drink type to each cow to maximize the number of cows who get both.Each dish or drink can only be consumed by one cow (i.e., once food type 2 is assigned to a cow, no other cow can be assigned food type 2).

**输入**

Line 1: Three space-separated integers: *N*, *F*, and *D* Lines 2..*N*+1: Each line *i* starts with a two integers *Fi* and *Di*, the number of dishes that cow *i* likes and the number of drinks that cow *i* likes. The next *Fi* integers denote the dishes that cow *i* will eat, and the *Di* integers following that denote the drinks that cow *i* will drink.

**输出**

Line 1: A single integer that is the maximum number of cows that can be fed both food and drink that conform to their wishes

**样例输入**

```
4 3 3
2 2 1 2 3 1
2 2 2 3 1 2
2 2 1 3 1 2
2 1 1 3 3
```

**样例输出**

```
3
```

**提示**

One way to satisfy three cows is:
Cow 1: no meal
Cow 2: Food #2, Drink #2
Cow 3: Food #1, Drink #1
Cow 4: Food #3, Drink #3
The pigeon-hole principle tells us we can do no better since there are only three kinds of food or drink. Other test data sets are more challenging, of course.

**题解**

本着所有复杂题目都可以拆解为递归问题求解的想法，再看数据规模也只有100左右，并不是很大，首先尝试了递归的方法。在测试集上取得了正确的结果，但提交时则遭遇了`Time Limit Exceeded`困境。

```c++
int process(bool* dishes_used, bool* drinks_used, int start){
	if (start == N - 1){
		for (int u = 0; u < dishes[start].size();u++)
		for (int v = 0; v < drinks[start].size(); v++){
			int a = dishes[start][u];
			int b = drinks[start][v];
			if (!(dishes_used[a] || drinks_used[b])) return 1;
		}
		return 0;
	}
	int answer = process(dishes_used, drinks_used, start + 1);
	for (int u = 0; u < dishes[start].size(); u++){
		for (int v = 0; v < drinks[start].size(); v++){
			int a = dishes[start][u];
			int b = drinks[start][v];
			if (dishes_used[a] || drinks_used[b]) continue;
			dishes_used[a] = true;
			drinks_used[b] = true;
			answer = max(answer, 1+ process(dishes_used, drinks_used, start + 1));
			dishes_used[a] = false;
			drinks_used[b] = false;
		}
	}
	return answer;
}
```



之后尝试了**网络流的方法**。

**总结**

尝试网络流解法时提交遇到了`wrong answer`, 检查后发现是没有注释掉调试函数`print_graph()`所致。
