### 2017-2-D: The Unique MST

**总时间限制**: 1000ms **内存限制**: 65536kB

**描述**

Given a connected undirected graph, tell if its minimum spanning tree is unique.  

Definition 1 (Spanning Tree): 

Consider a connected, undirected graph $G = (V, E)$. A spanning tree of $G$ is a subgraph of $G$, say $T = (V', E')$, with the following properties: 

1. $V' = V$. 

2. $T$ is connected and acyclic. 

Definition 2 (Minimum Spanning Tree):

Consider an edge-weighted, connected, undirected graph G = (V, E). The minimum spanning tree T = (V, E') of G is the spanning tree that has the smallest total cost. The total cost of T means the sum of the weights on all the edges in E'. 

**输入**

The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 20), the number of test cases. Each case represents a graph. It begins with a line containing two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 100), the number of nodes and edges. Each of the following m lines contains a triple (xi, yi, wi), indicating that xi and yi are connected by an edge with weight = wi. For any two nodes, there is at most one edge connecting them.

**输出**

For each input, if the MST is unique, print the total cost of it, or otherwise print the string 'Not Unique!'.
