**描述**

Gabiluso is one of the greatest spies in his country. Now he’s trying to complete an “impossible” mission ----- to make it slow for the army of City Colugu to reach the airport. City Colugu has n bus stations and m roads. Each road connects two bus stations directly, and all roads are one way streets. In order to keep the air clean, the government bans all military vehicles. So the army must take buses to go to the airport. There may be more than one road between two bus stations. If a bus station is destroyed, all roads connecting that station will become no use. What’s Gabiluso needs to do is destroying some bus stations to make the army can’t get to the airport in k minutes. It takes exactly one minute for a bus to pass any road. All bus stations are numbered from 1 to n. The No.1 bus station is in the barrack and the No. n station is in the airport. The army always set out from the No. 1 station.  No.1 station and No. n station can’t be destroyed because of the heavy guard. Of course there is no road from No.1 station to No. n station.  Please help Gabiluso to calculate the minimum number of bus stations he must destroy to complete his mission. 

**输入**

There are several test cases. Input ends with three zeros. For each test case: The first line contains 3 integers, n, m and k. (0 < n <= 50,0 < m <= 4000, 0 < k < 1000) Then m lines follows. Each line contains 2 integers, s and f, indicating that there is a road from station No. s to station No. f.

**输出**

For each test case, output the minimum number of stations Gabiluso must destroy.

**题解**

①跑一遍最短路Floyd

②对应每一条输入进来的边进行判断，如果map\[1\][u]+map\[u\][v]+map\[v\][n]<=k，那么将这条边加入网络中。

③我们得到一个子图，这个子图中从1无论怎么走到n都是最短路小于等于k的一个图，如果我们将这个图变成了不连通的，那么对应原图，就是一个从1到n要么是没有路径到达，要么是有路径到达不可能有任何一条路径使得从1到n的最短路小于等于k，那么这个限制k就被我们搞定了。

④对应生成出来的子图，我们拆点一分为2，并且在其间建立一条有向边，权值设定为1，表示一个点只能拆一次。特殊拆点，从1到1+n以及从n到n+n这两个点拆分出来之后其间建立的容量为INF.

⑤对应每一条加进来的边，我们：add（u+n[u+n表示u拆分出来的点的编号]，v，1）

⑥设定1为源点S，设定n*2为汇点T。

全部搞定之后，跑一遍Dinic即可。
